- Business understanding: it requires communication and clarity 
- Data understanding: data is collected at this stage of the process. CRISP-DM combines the stages of Data Requirements, Data Collection, and Data Understanding from the Foundational Methodology outline. 
- Data Preparation.
- Modelling: both Foundation Methodology and CRISP-DM are required.
- Evaluation: results are used to determine efficacy of the model and foreshadows its role in the next and final stage. 
- Deployment

- [Case studying - From Problem to Approach](<a href='3-%20Data%20Science%20Methodologies/DS0103EN-1-1-1-From-Problem-to-Approach-v2.0.pdf'>DS0103EN-1-1-1-From-Problem-to-Approach-v2.0.pdf</a>)

### Analytic approach 

- Determine probabilities of an action 
	- **Predictive Model**

- Show relationships 
	- **Descriptive Model**

- Request *yes* or *no* answer 
	- **Classification Model** 
		- [[Decision Tree]]

### Data collection 
- Case studying - From Requirement to Collection

### Modeling
Model evaluation has two main phases
- a diagnostic measures phase
- statistical significance testing 

### Deployment 
- Assimilate knowledge for business 

### Feedback 
- Define review process 
- Refine model 
- Review and refine intervention actions
