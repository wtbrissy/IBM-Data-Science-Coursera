# Read - Detecting outliners 
## Visualisation tools 
### **Box plot**: 
A method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.  **Outliers** maybe plotted as **individuals** points.

Above plot shows three points between 10 to 12, there are outliers as there are not included in the box of other observation 

### Scatter plot 
A type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically tow variables for a set of data. The data are displayed as a **collection of points**.

## Mathematical function 
### Z-Score
The signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured. 

### IQR-Score 
The interquartile range (IQR), is also called midspread or middle 50%, or technically **H-spread**,is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quality, IQR = Q3 - Q1. 
*It is a measure of dispersion similar to standard deviation or variance, but is much more robust against outliers.*

## Correcting, removing outliers
