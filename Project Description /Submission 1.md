---

1. ***Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science?*** **(3 marks)**

    **Data Science** is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It involves *mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualisation*, and *machines learning*, etc. It could use machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models. It is a board term encompasses the entire data processing methodology. 

    **Data Scientist**
    Data Scientist is the person who implement data analytic skills to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy. A qualified data scientist should use tables and plots which are summarised through analytical tools, to build the narrative to communicate the findings. 

2. ***As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in?*** **(1 mark)**

    I would like to use my data analytical skills to help mining companies to get insights to improve operation productivities, optimise shipping schedules, and maximise the capacity of products inventories, etc. 

3. ***Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the **ten** main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project?*** **(5 marks)**

    The structure of the final report for a Data Scientist project should include a *cover page*, *table of contents*, *executive summary*, *introductory*,  *methodology*,  *results*,  *discussion*, *conclusion*, *acknowledgements*, *reference* and *appendices*.
